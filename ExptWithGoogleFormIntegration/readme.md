This is a test case to integrate html/javascript experiments with Google Forms. It uploads data to one single csv (across all sessions) per trial. The idea was to use hidden iframes to post the data without moving away from the experiment.

On google forms, just have one text field (paragraph). Make sure to note the id of this field and the response form url using the source viewer (ctrl+u), edit accordingly on the html. See notes.pdf for some screenshots of the form setup.

Here for the experiment to try: https://syaheed.github.io/ExptWithGoogleFormIntegration/testExpt1.html
* Just note where the green marker is and mouse over that side when the two circles turn white.
* Mouse mover the central white marker after the response to start the next trial
