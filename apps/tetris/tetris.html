<h1>Tetris and Strategy</h1>

<p> Just an idea that came to mind: The way to get a higher score, in Tetris, is to prepare for a line piece and get a 'tetris' (clear 4 rows at once). Being interested in probability learning, I wonder, if we manipulate the probability of the line piece, or make it's appearance contingent on something else, is the participant (or rather, the gamer) going to learn it and adapt his strategy? </p>

<p> This version of tetris was coded by me in Pygame, making use of Numpy arrays. Supply your own sound files!</p>
