<h1>Making recommendations using a dissimilarity matrix</h1>
  
<p>How do we use data to make recommendations of other options based on knowing an option that a user likes?</p>  
<p>In this exercise we use the Jester data collected by <a href="https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/jester-data/"Ken Goldberg</a>.</p>
<p>Data consists of 100 jokes that are rated by users, on a scale from -10 to 10.</p> 
<p>A simple way would be to calculate, for each option, the mean distance to other options.</p>
<p>We can then compute a dissimilarity matrix, with 0 being things that are the nearest, and 1 being the things no similiar.</p>
<p>We can plot the result as such, just to visualization purposes.</p>

<br>

<p>Given this matrix, it is easy, for any given option/joke to select the n-best joke/options that have the least distance/ most similiar.</p>  
<p>The code used, including the one used for plotting, can be found <a href="https://github.com/syaheed/syaheed.github.io/blob/main/apps/dis_recom/dis_recom.R">here</a>.</p>
<br>

<p>Based on this we can go on to make other models or more complex ones, just as figuring out if there are joke/option clusters</p>
<p>The above code should be general enough that it could translate to any type of data that has numerical ratings.</p>
