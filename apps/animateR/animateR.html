<h1>Animations in R</h1>

<p> Sometimes it is helpful to visualise data in time, especially when doing signal processing. While this can be done easily in Matlab by using <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/videowriter.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com">VideoWriter</a> on a structure that contains per-frame information, there doesn't seem to be an equivalent in (base) R. <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> is a great tool for video conversions that can be used via a command-line interface. What could be done is to generate images in R representing each frame, and then calling ffmpeg to stich the images up into a movie format. Here is an example of phase shifting a sine wave 1 degree per frame:</p>
