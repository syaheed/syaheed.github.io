<h1>Which country has the best food?</h1>

<p>Food can be an essential part of travel. Indeed for some, it might be THE reason for travel. What countries have the best food though?</p>
<p>How do you even quantify this question? User ratings might be one, though it definitely has its biases.</p>
<br>  
<p>Let's look at some countries' Zomato user ratings across restaurants. We can, from the limited data, see: </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">   1: Which countries have the best average ratings per restaurant that was rated </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">   2: Which countries have the cheapest prices per person on average </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">   3: Which countries have the best rated food for the cheapest (aka, where should a foodie on a budget go for a holiday?) </p> 
<br>

<p>Hmm, looks like certain parts of the world might be better than others for foodies? </p>
<p>Don't like the results? Feel free to adapt the <a href="https://github.com/syaheed/syaheed.github.io/blob/main/apps/foodRatings/foodRatings.R">R code</a> to feed in data you think is more representative.</p>  
<p>This was a pretty fun quick project that used a bit of fuzzy logic in string matching (stringdist), some code for currency conversion (priceR), and a package on how to map data (rworldmap).</p>
