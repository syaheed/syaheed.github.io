<h1>On Statistical Tests</h1>
<br>

<p>What stats are appropriate for comparing paired data?</p>
<br>

<p>We can first start by thinking about 2 cases.</p>
<p>1) where a set of numbers (say 30) is pulled from the same normal distribution</p>
<p>2) where a set of numbers (say 30) is pulled from the a different normal distribution</p>  
<br>

<p>Logically, the two cases should give you different statistics. In case 2, the sets should be significantly different.</p>
<p>But is that the only thing we need to look out for?</p>
<p>Clearly no. We can look at effect size, the power of the test, what Bayesian tests say about the data, etc.</p>
<p>Consider the output from this <a href="https://github.com/syaheed/syaheed.github.io/blob/main/apps/stats/stats_paired.R">custom code</a></p>

<br>

<p>Potentially important information might be: </p>
<p>1) How many in set B is increased/decreased from its pair in set A. This tells you if the effect is driven by just a few cases or majority of cases. </p>
<p>2) What the actual group means, standard deviation and standard error are. See the note in the above figure caption though.</p>

<p>This is part of a <a href="https://github.com/syaheed/public-code/blob/master/customRfunctions.R">larger set of custom R code</a> I am compiling so I can import my code using <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/source.html">source</a> technique.</p>
