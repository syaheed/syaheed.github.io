<h1>(Mis)adventures with ChatGPT</h1>

<p>I wanted to play around with ChatGPT, figure out how it works, where I could make use of it, and what it's (current) limitations are.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/syaheed/syaheed.github.io/blob/main/apps/chatGPT/Analysis%20of%20Synthetic%20Data.ipynb"></a>Previously, we tried using ChatGPT to generate and then analyse a dataset, which I thought it did impressively well in.</p>  
<p>But in that case, it can be guided function by function. What about something more complex, with many moving parts?</p>
<br>
  
<p>To that end, I wanted to see if ChatGPT could code some basic game mechanics, and to document observations.</p>
<p>Since I am familiar with PyGame, I asked ChatGPT to code in that.</p>
<p>Rules are I can give hints to ChatGPT where I think the error is, but I can't edit the code myself.</p>
<p>The prompt used for all of these is for ChatGPT to take on the role of an expert game developer, and particularly one that codes in Python/Pygame.</p>

<h2>A mariolike</h2>
<p>The jump functionality was initially broken. A few prompts later (x3 attempts), instead of not being able to jump, the character just went through the floor.</p>
<p>Then jumping worked, but only on the ground, and not on the platforms. After 2 attempts, the jumping was fixed.</p>
<p>Unlike a normal 2d platfomrer, the game screen was static. I asked for a scrolling level, which it got right on the first try!</p>
<p>There are stil many things to add, like enemies, the level endpoint and maybe some items, and maybe we can revisit this later.</p>
<p>The code for the mariolike can be found <a href="https://github.com/syaheed/syaheed.github.io/blob/main/apps/mariolike/mariolike.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>Addendum: So I asked it to implement a scrolling screen, checkpoints and levels. This is when everything starts to go haywire.</p>
<p>The shifting world made the calculations go berserk, and although it was easy for me to fix the issue manually, ChatGPT could not fix it.</p>
<p>Even after about 30 prompts and collaborating to debug the progam by printing x-coordinates (my idea), the solutions seem to get worse and worse.</p>
<p>One take away I think is to focus on more modular code, where each function cannot interact with another except in very specific ways.</p>
