<h1>(Mis)adventures with ChatGPT</h1>

<p>I wanted to play around with ChatGPT, figure out how it works, where I could make use of it, and what it's (current) limitations are.</p>
<p>To that end, I wanted to see if it could code some basic game mechanics, and to document observations.</p>
<p>Since I am familiar with PyGame, I asked ChatGPT to code in that.</p>
<p>Rules are I can give hints to ChatGPT where I think the error is, but I can't edit the code myself.</p>
<p>The prompt used for all of these is for ChatGPT to take on the role of an expert game developer, and particularly one that codes in Python/Pygame.</p>

<h2>A mariolike</h2>
<p>The code for the mariolike can be found <a href="../mariolike/mariolike.py">here</a>.</p>

<p>The games mentioned were used ias inspiration for game mechanics only. No commercial/copyrighted assets were used.</p>
<p>Will be updating this page ...</p>
