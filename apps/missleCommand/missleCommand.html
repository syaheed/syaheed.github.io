<h1>Perceptual Judgements in a video game?</h1>

<p>Two things I'm interested in are games, and psychophysics. Given that cognitive experiments are basically games anyway (albeit, really boring ones) can we have a game that is essentially a perceptual task? After trying to program <a href="../tetris/tetris.html">Tetris</a>, I thought about more games and remembered Missle Command, where you have to make bearing judgements ... Long story short, here's a demo of a modified Missle Command game/task.</p>

<p>Many possibilities for 'attentional' manipulations here. What if a target appears from an unexpected location? What if the speed was varied and had a distribution. What if there was a probable angle for hitting the target for each of those 'cannons'? </p>
