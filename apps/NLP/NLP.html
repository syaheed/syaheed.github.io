<h1>What can psycholiguistics contribute to NLP?</h1>

<p>Psycholinguistics is the study of the relationships between linguistic behaviour and psychological processes, including the process of language acquisition.</p>  
<p>There have been multiple factors that are known to affect lexical processing, and we might want to consider those in building NLP models. Such factors include not only obvious things like word length and number of syllabus, but also word prevalence/frequency.</p>  
<br>
  
<p>Word prevalence data in particular are useful for gauging the difficulty of words and could be used a metric for the richness of vocabulary.</p>  
<p>Word prevalences across various media has been studied and there are databases to use in analyses, e.g., <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-018-1077-9">the data complied by Brysbaert and colleagues</a>.</p>
